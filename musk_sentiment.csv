This is really useful info, previously they said 700k ""artillery shells"" in 2024. That could have included 105 mm and maybe larger mortar shells.

700k of *specifically* 155 mm by 2025 sounds good to me. Here are announcements so far

I just finished counting @Vishun_military's footage of all major storage bases they bought to help them with AFVs. Without revealing anything, Russian storage situation is a lot more dire than I thought. Many bases are close to depletion and other still hold hundreds of armored vehicles, but they have been thoroughly cannibalized. I always feared I was a bit optimistic with my 1,5-2 years until depletion of Russian stored equipment estimate, but now I think I'm being a bit conservative.

They made ""cis"" a hate word on twitter. That is not an open discussion.

You also said that in response to nazis and incels. Therei is no complex, open discussion with nazis. They're nazis. Their idea of an open discussion is a bullet in non-white people and anyone else who is an ""other"" brain. Nazis literally made Hitler a dictator with supreme power. That is the opposite of an open disccusion lmao.

Starmer's taken down Grooming gangs so this comment is a bit... shit.

Fucking glad we have a PM that takes shit seriously for a change, refused to engage with Elon and instead applied pressure to X instead.

The irony is that X has a major issue with indecent images of minors and far right nutters (why do the two so often go hand in hand?), and if Starmer wants to decimate Elon Musk he can call for a national inquiry into X's sexual abuse images.

It's something else to have a court decide something, disagree, and just do whatever you want.

Perhaps the 'Supreme' nature of this court impacts that logic. E.g., there is no further judicial remedy, so Musk is basically saying ""I'll do what I want, try to stop me.""",2024-08-30 19:03:00

That's American pseudohistory. The 13 colonies weren't treated any worse than other colonies, and were actually pretty well off. The American revolution was initiated by the elite of the colonies for reasons that mainly benefitted them and not the common man.

This bill just gives ACMA the power to compel social media companies to follow misinformation laws and guidelines in exactly the same way traditional media companies have to. ACMA (and the ABA before it) have had the legal authority to compel ISPs to block content deemed offensive from being viewed by Australians under the Broadcasting Services Act for over 30 years. That legislation is a lot broader than the Combating Misinformation and Disinformation Amendment, and we seem to be doing just fine
